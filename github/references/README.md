### Branching
In my journey of using GitHub, I have found that branching is very useful when
developing your projects. The use of cactus model with local branches is
apparently very useful. This is one short explation about how
branching works in GitHub [ref](https://barro.github.io/2016/02/a-succesful-git-branching-model-considered-harmful/).

For a deeper explanation go to
